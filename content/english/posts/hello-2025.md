Hah! Last year ended sooner than expected. Last year has been a real hectic year of my whole life.  From the darkest days to brightest nights, I feel like I have seen and felt every pain life has to offer. The start of 2024 was very difficult and exhausting but I hope, really hope 2025 will be a little peaceful for me.

Though It has been difficult, I still managed to pull off some incredible feats.

I wrote and published my first mobile game, on Play Store. By the way, the source code is available on GitHub, it is made with the Godot game engine.

This year, I have become much more mentally strong and resilient to 'changes'. My mental health also improved dramatically. This reminds me of the first part of Michael Hopf's famous line's first part "Hard times create strong men...."!

I made some progress in two of my unfinished novels, though they are far from complete, but I must say I enjoy working on these two. Apart from these, I wrote a few short stories and essays for magazines which got highly praised. I tried some experimental storytelling techniques and people liked that as per my knowledge. 

2024 was a very literature-focused year, I read many fiction and non-fiction. Plus I read huge amounts of comics, mangas, manhwas (South Korean comics), Manhuas (Chinese comics), and Western and Indian comics. If I had to mention most enjoyable ones, for manga, Ron Kamonohashi: Deranged Detective and The Disastrous Life of Saiki K;

Basically, I read too much; but Noticed a surprising change in myself, my reading speed has increased exponentially, and the ability to remember what I read has also improved. My reading speed has increased so much, that recently when someone gave me something to read, I finished so fast that they thought I didn't read or skipped major parts; still, these skills turned out to be helpful in my daily life.

Last, by not least, I started investing time in physical fitness, I even started practicing boxing, and I can feel newfound strength in my body.

So.. my readers, I hope this year becomes a happy and peaceful time for you folks. Have a nice year!

Ah, I forgot to mention, I am planning to get married this year.
