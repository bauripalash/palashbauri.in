You are invited to the birthday party of your niece, what you would do, bring a present üéÅ for her and maybe bring some chocolates üç´ too as a bonus, but there could be your other family members who brought their toddlers, they *may* feel left out. I am not saying they definitely will feel that, but children are naive,

What I do usually in that scenario is, I always bring 4 or 5 extra chocolates, when I know other children will be there.

Children are sweet and they certainly will be happy and surprised. This small gesture of thoughtfulness can bring extra smiles. üòä
