I first joined Mastodon back in 2018. I chose `mastodon.social` as the Instance
of choice because it was the biggest. 19 toots later, in 2022 I created an
account in `fosstodon.org` instance, which I have been using since. But last
night, I decided to take an indefinite break from mastodon altogether.

I joint Mastodon because it seemed cool, and was the new hot topic at that time,
but gradually I got bored and frustrated with the whole ecosystem. I believe
that the whole idea of the Fediverse is fundamentally flawed, I am not going to
explain here what those are; but the keyword *self-hosting* is kind of getting
killed with mastodon's ecosystem.

If you want to find me, you **may** find me on Twitter [^1], telegram[^2], 
email[^3]. Plus, I mostly do microblogging on my writefreely instance at
[notes.palashbauri.in](https://notes.palashbauri.in).

See You Soon!
