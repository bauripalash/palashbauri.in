Everyone wants to be me. I speak decent english, I'm a programmer. People think me something like a computer guru. Once I was even asked to fix a relative's laptop, their keyboard wasn't working. 

Everyone wants be me but nobody really wants to know me, though I'm not that surprised, because you see, people nowadays likes to get instant results.  People have this bad tendency of assuming that, if you do the same things like the other person does, you'll become like them. 

If I woke up Tomorrow, keep my hair messy and scribble numbers on paper, would I become Einstein?

You can dress like me, you can talk like me, you can copy my whole appearance but you'd never be me.

It's something like, that "Ship of Theseus" thought experiment. A person is not just a structure of blood and flesh, a person is an idea.

A simple question, What I am?

A primitive structure of information. My body is not the entirety of me, instead it is a part of me, my intelligence  , my brain, my ideas , neither of them are not the entirety of me?

I am just a, Structure of Information!
