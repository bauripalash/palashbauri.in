## I want freedom?

Choice?  <br>
Like I have it.  
Freedom?  
Like i know it.  
Walls of glass,  
See it, but. 
don't ever touch.  
Prism of dreams,  
Hope it,  
Don't ever do.  
All making me. 
Serve my master,  
Better and better.  
Slave? Am i?  
No, I have a choice,  
Choice to be free.  
Will I break the chain?  
No, I shall not; as,  
I want in to  Society.
