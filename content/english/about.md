**Hi, I am Palash Bauri.**

Subhas Open University, India.

Since I was 11‚Äì12 years old, I have been writing computer programs. I create
programs that can be useful, fun, or totally silly. You can find most of my
open source programs at [github/bauripalash](https://github.com/bauripalash).

From the age of 12-13, I have been writing stories, poems, and essays in both
English and Bengali language (my mother tongue). Many of my short stories and
essays in Bengali have been published in a few renowned Bengali magazines such
as *Kishore Bharati*, *Jnan o Bijnaan* and many more.

I have also published a book `‡¶Ü‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂‡¶ó‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶™` (ISBN: *978-93-91776-10-7*) (English : `Aakashgolpo`;
Trans: Tale of Sky), which is a collection of essays written in Bengali.

If you would like to know me better, or just chat, you can reach me in multiple
ways, you can drop me an *email* (address mentioned in footer), If you use
Twitter, you can DM me at `@bauripalash`. If you use telegram, you can text me
at `@bauripalash`. As you can see most of my usernames on the internet are just
`bauripalash`. Feel free to reach me, I would like to talk, I maybe be late
but I always reply.
