## Interests

My interests are very broad, most prominent ones are Comuters, Technology and Literature. 

At the age of 7, I first poem got published in Magazine. Since then I have written more than hundred short stories, poems in both English and Bengali. Bengali is my native language. My writings consist of science fiction, social drama, suspense which mostly targets children and teenagers (yes, complicated mix). 

Apart from these, I write essays on topics such as science, psychology and philosophy in Bengali Language. 

In 2022, my first book got published, 
**"‡¶Ü‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂‡¶ó‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶™"** (English name : **"Aakashgolpo"**, meaning, Tale of Sky) ISBN: 978-93-91776-10-7.  Which is a collection of few of my selected Bengali essays in topics such as Science, Philosophy, Psychology and some other randoms. 

I also very much fond of reading. I have read more than hundred fiction books, which includes Novels, Short Stories, Poems etc. My favorite genres to read in fiction are science fiction, suspense and historical fictions. I have read plenty of non-fictions, which mostly consisted of History and Science. I also like reading Comics, Mangas (Japanese comics), Manhwas (korean comics, also known as webtoons).

I also love watching movies, animes, web series and documentaries, and recently I have started watching some korean dramas.

Finally, I write softwares, from intriguing to just straight up silly things. I have been working on developing a programming language for the Bengali Language which is almost complete. I am not that into building websites and working on servers like people usually suspect. You can find more about my current projects on [github.com/bauripalash](https://github.com/bauripalash)
